# 1930. Unique Length-3 Palindromic Subsequences

#### Given a string s, return the number of unique palindromes of length three that are a subsequence of s.

Note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted once.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
 

## Example 1:

```
Input: s = "aabca"
Output: 3
Explanation: The 3 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
- "aba" (subsequence of "aabca")
- "aaa" (subsequence of "aabca")
- "aca" (subsequence of "aabca")
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: s = "adc"
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no palindromic subsequences of length 3 in "adc".
```

## Example 3:

```
Input: s = "bbcbaba"
Output: 4
Explanation: The 4 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
- "bbb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "bcb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "bab" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "aba" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
```

## Constraints:

```
3 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of only lowercase English letters.
```

import string

class Solution:
    
    @staticmethod
    def getFirstOccurence(char: str, charArray: str) -> int:
        for ind, val in enumerate(charArray):
            if val == char:
                return ind
        return -1
            
    def countPalindromicSubsequence(self, s: str) -> int:
        palindromes = 0
        revStr = s[::-1]
        lens = len(s)
        for char in string.ascii_lowercase:
            firstOcc = Solution.getFirstOccurence(char,s)
            if firstOcc == -1:
                continue
            secondOcc = lens - Solution.getFirstOccurence(char,revStr) -1
            if secondOcc > firstOcc:
                palindromes += len(set(s[(firstOcc+1):secondOcc]))
        return palindromes
