# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

 
```
Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
Example 4:

Input: s = ""
Output: 0
```

#### Constraints:
```
0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
```

## Optimized Sliding Window hash-map

Complexity:

- Time - O(n) 'n' being the string length
- Space - O(min(m,n)) 'm' being the size of character set. In english language if we only account for `a-z` m=26

```py
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(s) < 2:
            return len(s)
        
        hashT = dict()
        left = 0
        maxLen = 0
        for right in range(left, len(s)):
            if s[right] in hashT:
                # Trick part: We can't use a value of left which was already accounted for. So we either update left to right edge or we keep left as is.
                # Try example "abba" to understand why the link below is so important here
                left = max(hashT[s[right]], left)
            maxLen = max(maxLen, right-left+1)
            hashT[s[right]] = right+1

        return maxLen
```
